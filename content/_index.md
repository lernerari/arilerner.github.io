Hi! I am a PhD student in Operations Research at the Yale School of Management. I am 
interested in algorithm & mechanism design for social good and non-profit applications. 
Prior to graduate school, I spent two years as an economic consultant at Analysis Group 
where I focused on energy, climate & natural resources and health economics & outcomes 
research. I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Tufts University. 

In my free time, I enjoy charcoal drawing, reading literary fiction and essays 
([a list of favorites](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/127721629?shelf=favorites&view=covers)), watching old Soviet films, and 
feeling the unnecessary stress of supporting both Chelsea F.C. and my hometown Boston Celtics.
